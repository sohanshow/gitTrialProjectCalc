## gitTrialProjectCalc

## Hi there. This is a standard calculator which I built overnight for gitHub. 
   If you want to just run it and test the application (.jar file) then go to:
   dist folder then download ss_calculator and run it in your local machine. 
   <br />
   
   NOTE: You would need Java runtime to be installed in your system fo rthis to work. 
         If you don't have it then go here: https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
         and here: https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html
         
   <br />
   
   The main code for the application is in src/mainFrame
   
   <br />
   
### Language Used: Java.
